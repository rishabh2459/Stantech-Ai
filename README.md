 Stantech assignment

In this assignment, I utilized the Google API to integrate the application and leveraged the Expo library for location services. Additionally, I customized the marker image to an arrow and ensured that the tracking line is displayed when the user changes their location every 10 minutes. Furthermore, I implemented search fields for both origin and destination, allowing users to specify their locations and visualize the route between them.

Regarding the battery saver functionality, I plan to employ the Expo library to determine whether battery saver mode or airplane mode is enabled. This feature can be managed seamlessly through either the Expo library or the React Native device-info package.

Feel free to react out if there is any issue with the assignment or code. Apk file is also submitted.
